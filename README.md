# Solar system simulation

A numeric simulation of our _current_ solar system.


## Instalation guide

### Dependencies

- Python 3 (I think any version should be fine)
- Numpy (Install with ```pip3 install numpy```
  - You can install the ```pip``` command with ```sudo apt install python3-pip```

### Cloning the repository and running the simulation

1. Navigate to a folder where you want to store the program. 
2. Use the command ```git clone https://github.com/marcusGH/solar-system-simulation.git .``` to clone the repository into that folder.
3. In the same directory as ```main.py``` run the simulation with ```python3 main.py DELTAT``` where ```DELTAT``` is the timestep used in the simulation.

### Simulation controls

- Use ```ASDW``` to move about
- Zoom in and out using the up and down arrows, respectively.
